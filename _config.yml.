title: City management 
description: The City Management System is designed to streamline and enhance the operations and services provided within a city. It is divided into four interconnected but independent modules, each focusing on a critical aspect of urban management. These modules are:

Resident Management
This module focuses on maintaining detailed records of the city's residents, including their personal information, household details, and demographic data. It enables efficient communication with residents, facilitates service requests, and supports initiatives like voter registration, healthcare, and public notifications.

Infrastructure Management
This module handles the planning, maintenance, and monitoring of city infrastructure. It keeps track of roads, buildings, utilities, and other public facilities. Key features include scheduling repairs, monitoring construction projects, and ensuring the city infrastructure meets safety and regulatory standards.

Services Management
The Services module oversees the administration of essential public services, such as waste management, water supply, electricity, and emergency services. It ensures that these services are delivered effectively and tracks requests, complaints, and feedback from residents to improve overall service quality.

Transport Management
This module manages the city's transportation network, including public transit systems, traffic control, and parking facilities. It aims to optimize traffic flow, reduce congestion, and provide accessible transportation options for all citizens. Features include scheduling public transportation, monitoring traffic patterns, and planning future transportation projects.

Each module works independently but contributes to the broader goal of creating a smart, efficient, and livable city for its residents.
